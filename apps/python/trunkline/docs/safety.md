# Safety notes

Trunkline places real phone calls to health plans and handles patient identifiers. This document states what it will and will not do, and where each rule is enforced.

## Who is called

Trunkline calls **health plan provider-services lines**, which are published business numbers staffed to take exactly these questions. It does not call patients. That is a product boundary, not a configuration option: there is no patient-facing workflow, and the disclosure envelopes carry no patient contact details.

The distinction matters legally as well as ethically. The FCC's February 2024 declaratory ruling treats AI-generated voices as artificial under the TCPA, which governs calls to consumers. A provider's billing office calling its payer about a submitted claim is business-to-business administrative contact and does not sit in that regime the same way.

## Explicit intent

No call happens without a person asking for it.

- `preview` and `fixture` modes place no call at all and need no credentials.
- `live` mode requires `--yes` on an interactive run **and** a written authorization record for the payer, naming the exact destination, an expiry date, and a maximum number of calls.
- An unattended scheduled run carries no `--yes`. The authorization record is the operator's separately written consent, and it expires and runs out on its own.

## Destinations

- Numbers must be full E.164 and must match the payer record's region.
- North American numbers are checked against NANP rules; premium-rate area codes are refused.
- A live run refuses if the payer's number no longer matches the authorized destination character for character.
- Every number is masked wherever it is printed, stored, or rendered: `+12*******42`.

## Patient identifiers

- Identifiers live in `data/vault/`, one owner-readable file per patient reference. The ledger stores only the reference.
- `policy.DISCLOSURE_ENVELOPES` names the only fields each workflow may disclose. Eligibility discloses less than claim status, because it needs less.
- `policy.NEVER_DISCLOSE` fields are dropped by the resolver even if an envelope names one, and `plan.build_plan` refuses to return a task whose text contains one.
- Transcripts are scrubbed between verification and persistence.
- `trunkline vault-check` walks every file outside the vault and looks for every identifier in it. The test suite runs the same check after a call that spoke the member id aloud.

## What the agent may never do on the call

The full list is in `policy.AGENT_BOUNDARIES` and is appended verbatim to every task. In summary: no appeal filed or withdrawn, no amount accepted or disputed, no claim changed, no Social Security number or full address given, no clinical discussion, no guessing, and no argument that a claim is owed.

If a representative will not proceed without something Trunkline does not disclose, the agent records what the billing office must supply and ends the call.

## Disclosure

Every call opens by stating that the caller is an AI assistant calling for the provider's billing office, and that the call may be recorded. Twelve states require all-party consent to record; Trunkline discloses in every state rather than tracking each line's location.

## Recurring work and cancellation

Trunkline runs no scheduler. A host scheduler runs one cycle; the suppression reasons decide whether a call happens. There is no provider-side recurrence, so there is no hidden schedule to discover later.

Stopping is immediate and has three independent switches:

1. `trunkline kill-switch on` refuses every call while the file exists.
2. `trunkline revoke --payer <id>` deletes the authorization and live runs refuse.
3. Removing the scheduler entry stops future cycles.

A call already accepted by CALL-E completes; `trunkline reconcile` folds the result in rather than leaving a claim stuck.

## Duplicate calls

Claims are marked `pending_call` and written to disk before the request leaves the machine, with a fresh idempotency key sent as `Idempotency-Key`. A crash leaves them in `pending_reconciliation`, and nothing redials them until `reconcile` resolves the call against CALL-E or an operator clears it after confirming in the dashboard that no call exists.

## Medical, legal, financial, and emergency boundaries

Trunkline is an administrative product. It discusses claim adjudication with a claims representative and nothing else.

- **Medical:** no diagnosis, treatment, clinical advice, or discussion of care. Prior authorization is handled as a status question, never a clinical one.
- **Legal:** no appeals filed, no legal position taken, no mention of lawyers or regulators.
- **Financial:** no amount accepted, waived, negotiated, or disputed. No payment instrument is ever given.
- **Emergency:** Trunkline is not for urgent clinical situations. It calls billing departments during business hours about claims that have already been adjudicated.

## Credentials

The CALL-E key is read from the environment or a local `.env`, never committed, and sent only to `https://api.heycall-e.com`. A base URL pointing anywhere else is refused, except a loopback address while running in fixture mode. Nothing else reads the key: the console cannot place calls and has no access to it.

## What is stored, and where

| Path | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `data/ledger.json` | practices, payers, claims, call records, scrubbed transcripts. No identifiers |
| `data/vault/<ref>.json` | patient identifiers, owner-readable only |
| `data/authorizations/<payer>.json` | written live-call permission, with expiry and budget |
| `data/audit.log` | hash-chained append-only log of every planned, placed, and completed call |
| `data/KILL_SWITCH` | present means every call is refused |

Delete `data/` to remove everything. Deleting `data/vault/` alone leaves the ledger intact and unusable for further calls, which is the correct failure direction.
